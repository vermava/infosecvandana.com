      <description>Global Roundtable hosted by the ISRM Women in Security Sisterhood group.
The subject of Women in Technology is one that is at the forefront of multiple vectors, including diversity, equality, and need to encourage girls to take up STEM subjects.
One way to encourage that is to give examples of inspirational women who have achieved incredible things in their own fields.
Moderator - Danyetta Fleming Magana
Panelists
Dr. Amelia Estwick, Director, National Cybersecurity Institute, spent over 20 years in the INFOSEC/cybersecurity field with the Department of Defense /National Security Agency.</description>

      <description>Hi Everyone.
We are back again with another spotlight series project and today we have OWASP Security Knowledge Framework (SKF) with us. I feel that this is one project, which is so much relevant and this is required in any organization for training the developers, security researchers, for getting the requirements and whatnot.
The security framework wants to help developers &amp;amp; empower them, to be able to give them the right awareness and knowledge to build secure applications by design.</description>

      <description>We are back again with another oversaw spotlight series project, and this time we have a very interesting project, which is around Threat Modeling.
Fixing the bugs later in the stage can cost huge money. Now, when we all started talking about DevOps or DevSecOps, So it&amp;rsquo;s imperative that we bring in the Threat Model in #cloud, which is automated which have which have less of work for us, especially for testers for developers for anyone, Who is a part of the application development lifecycle and even for architects.</description>

      <title>OWASP Spotlight - Project 5 -  SecurityRAT</title>

      <description>Gathering the requirements and tracking them is always a challenge in the application development. The biggest concern area is if the security requirement changes then to track them.
The next project as part of OWASP Spotlight series helps in gathering the requirements and cherry on top of cake in automating them. SecurityRAT simplifies the security requirement management during development using automation approaches.

      <description>OWASP has so many amazing and great projects which can help organisations, developers, security testers and many more groups. However, working with OWASP projects very closely in the past few years, I have realised people do not know about a lot of projects or even have no clue if they exist.
So, here I am writing the part series on OWASP Projects with a video describing about the project. This is the second blog as part of the OWASP Spotlight Series talking about OWASP Dependency Check.</description>

      <description>We are all heading towards modernisation of applications. However, we still see the vulnerabilities like SQL Injection, Sensitive data exposure, and security misconfiguration etc. When the loopholes in applications (such as legacy, desktop, web, mobile, micro services) are exploited, it can give malicious actors access to the organisation&amp;rsquo;s data.
This is a fact that Breaches will happen and security flaws will exist, however what we can do is minimise the chances.</description>

      <description>Title: Running an appsec program with open source projects
We are all heading towards the modernization of applications. However, we still see the companies being impacted with the most common website vulnerabilities like SQL Injection, Sensitive data exposure, security misconfiguration, etc. OWASP has many projects which can be tied seamlessly into the application development pipeline structure. However, firstly we donât know if the projects exist, second, if we know about the projects, we do not know the exact working of the projects.</description>

      <description>Cloud Migration is the next big thing. Everyone wants to be in the cloud, but what about security and compliance standards? How do organizations manage both safety and security in the âCloud Eraâ? Cloud deployments render the concept that everyone inside of a corporate network should be trusted null and void. Essentially, when it comes to the cloud, everyone is a tenant on a big server farm full of tenants. Thus, the only way forward is the Zero-Trust Model.</description>

      <description>It will not be easy to go out even when the lockdown period is over. The way this pandemic is evolving, will take us far away from what we consider normal, and that is for a while. In such a scenario, how shall we be resuming the day to day operations post lockdown? The role of the security team is now more important than ever because of the pandemic and remote work models, the perimeter of the organization has been modified drastically.</description>

      <description>The time is challenging. No one ever believed that a pandemic would leave us stranded. We will be home for such a long time even though some of us always wanted to work from home but never this way. Most of the organisations are trying to keep the spirits of the employees high and making sure they are safe from the critical situation outside. For many companies especially start ups who didn&amp;rsquo;t have the infrastructure and facilities for the employees and were surviving just on the need base.</description>

      <description>Speaking at any Conference is a savoir faire itself. Most often I am asked when and how to start the Infosec speaking journey. My answer to them is fundamental: there is no juncture pre-defined for it. There is no age or qualification criteria to speak at any conference.
I started my journey by speaking at the local meets. Local meets gave me the platform to share my knowledge with a wider audience.</description>

      <description>Being an information security evangelist, I have been preaching and practicing security for more than a decade. Security is my bread and butter and I love it! I started with consulting roles, where I would use my skills to suggest solutions and improvements. Later, I transitioned to internal security teams which gave me a clear and concise perspective on how organizations manage security risk.
In my opinion, the Information Security Expert can be anyone who has a curiosity towards aspects of technology.</description>
