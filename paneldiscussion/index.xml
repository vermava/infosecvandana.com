      <description>Global Roundtable hosted by the ISRM Women in Security Sisterhood group.
The subject of Women in Technology is one that is at the forefront of multiple vectors, including diversity, equality, and need to encourage girls to take up STEM subjects.
One way to encourage that is to give examples of inspirational women who have achieved incredible things in their own fields.
