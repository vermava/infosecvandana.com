      <description>OWASP Spotlight - Project 19 - OWASP Application Security Verification standard (ASVS)
About the Project:-
The OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) Project provides a basis for testing web application technical security controls and also provides developers with a list of requirements for secure development.
The primary aim of the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) Project is to normalize the range in the coverage and level of rigor available in the market when it comes to performing Web application security verification using a commercially-workable open standard.</description>

      <description>OWASP Spotlight - Project 18 - OWASP DSOMM
About the Project:-
The DevSecOps Maturity Model, shows security measures which are applied when using DevOps strategies and how these can be prioritized. With the help of DevOps strategies security can also be enhanced. For example, each component such as application libraries and operating system libraries in docker images can be tested for known vulnerabilities. Attackers are intelligent and creative, equipped with new technologies and purpose.</description>

      <description>This project is an automated penetration testing tool, but it can be used for all sorts of interesting things because it is modular and basically it&amp;rsquo;s written in Python, and it allows you to do three different things. So it allows us to Perform scans Of the network. Originally it was created as an IoT scanner to scan IoT devices. So you can scan the network, it can discover your service your hosts, it can scan for open ports and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really quickly.</description>

      <description>The OWASP Top 10 is a standard awareness document for developers and web application security. It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications.
Globally recognized by developers as the first step towards more secure coding. Companies should adopt this document and start the process of ensuring that their web applications minimize these risks. Using the OWASP Top 10 is perhaps the most effective first step towards changing the software development culture within your organization into one that produces more secure code.</description>

      <description>Hi Everyone.
We are back again with another spotlight series project and today we have OWASP Security Knowledge Framework (SKF) with us. I feel that this is one project, which is so much relevant and this is required in any organization for training the developers, security researchers, for getting the requirements and whatnot.
The security framework wants to help developers &amp;amp; empower them, to be able to give them the right awareness and knowledge to build secure applications by design.</description>

      <description>We are back again with another oversaw spotlight series project, and this time we have a very interesting project, which is around Threat Modeling.
Fixing the bugs later in the stage can cost huge money. Now, when we all started talking about DevOps or DevSecOps, So it&amp;rsquo;s imperative that we bring in the Threat Model in #cloud, which is automated which have which have less of work for us, especially for testers for developers for anyone, Who is a part of the application development lifecycle and even for architects.</description>

      <title>OWASP Spotlight - Project 5 -  SecurityRAT</title>

      <description>Gathering the requirements and tracking them is always a challenge in the application development. The biggest concern area is if the security requirement changes then to track them.
The next project as part of OWASP Spotlight series helps in gathering the requirements and cherry on top of cake in automating them. SecurityRAT simplifies the security requirement management during development using automation approaches.

      <description>About the Project:-
The OWASP Cheat Sheet Series was created to provide a set of simple good practice guides for application developers and defenders to follow. Rather than focused on detailed best practices that are impractical for many developers and applications, they are intended to provide good practices that the majority of developers will actually be able to implement.

      <description>About the Project:- The OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) is a set of generic attack detection rules for use with ModSecurity or compatible web application firewalls. The CRS aims to protect web applications from a wide range of attacks, including the OWASP Top Ten, with a minimum of false alerts. The CRS provides protection against many common attack categories, including SQL Injection, Cross Site Scripting, Local File Inclusion, etc.</description>

      <description>OWASP has so many amazing and great projects which can help organisations, developers, security testers and many more groups. However, working with OWASP projects very closely in the past few years, I have realised people do not know about a lot of projects or even have no clue if they exist.
So, here I am writing the part series on OWASP Projects with a video describing about the project. This is the second blog as part of the OWASP Spotlight Series talking about OWASP Dependency Check.</description>
