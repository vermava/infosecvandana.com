      <description>Title: Running an appsec program with open source projects
We are all heading towards the modernization of applications. However, we still see the companies being impacted with the most common website vulnerabilities like SQL Injection, Sensitive data exposure, security misconfiguration, etc. OWASP has many projects which can be tied seamlessly into the application development pipeline structure. However, firstly we don’t know if the projects exist, second, if we know about the projects, we do not know the exact working of the projects.</description>

      <title>Keynote: Diversity And Inclusion - Not Just A Gender Gap - Vandana Verma </title>
      <link>https://infosecvandana.com/talks/appsecdc/</link>

      <description>There has been a lot of conversations around diversity and inclusion in the recent past. This is a step in a positive direction. The benefits of diversity in cybersecurity are clear. As an industry, we can do better, we need to do better. We need not only to keep the conversation going but to really place some action behind it. While homogenous teams feel easier to operate in, it can lead to stagnation, or specialisations in some aspects at the expense of others.</description>

      <description>Title: Shifting the DevSecOps Culture, Taking away the sugar piece and giving the pile to ants
We have been talking about the technical angle of DevSecOps. How do I go about building the DevSecOps culture in the organisation? So far Generally corporates are trying to have all three Plays and teams Dev, Sec and Ops team together. However, the Ideal DevSecOps idea is each individual should know what is happening in the whole process.</description>
