      <description>Colleges are doing exceptional work towards bringing cyber security closer to the students. Once such incident, I witnessed over the weekend, where I was invited to VIT Bhopal University as a Chief Guest and #keynote speaker at the launch of the VIT Bhopal Cyber Warriors Club where I shared my views around Careers in Cyber Security and what students can do make the future shine for our country.
It such a heartwarming experience to see the College Management going extra mile for the students to motivate the students to innovate in different faces of cyber security from creating CTF&amp;rsquo;s hardware, software to creating something totally incredible with #AI.</description>

      <title>Managing Security Operations in the Cloud</title>
      <link>https://infosecvandana.com/webinars/brightalk/</link>

      <description>The moment an organization starts making a move to Cloud, the way they look at their security changes as well. A traditional security operation is more focused towards a bunch of solutions such as Firewalls, IDS/IPS, Anti-Malware, etc. Security Operations in the cloud is more about following the pragmatic approach. It is about using effectively the huge set of already available resources in the cloud to effectively harden, monitor and defend cloud infrastructures and applications.</description>
