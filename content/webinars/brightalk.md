The moment an organization starts making a move to Cloud, the way they look at their security changes as well. A traditional security operation is more focused towards a bunch of solutions such as Firewalls, IDS/IPS, Anti-Malware, etc. Security Operations in the cloud is more about following the pragmatic approach. It is about using effectively the huge set of already available resources in the cloud to effectively harden, monitor and defend cloud infrastructures and applications.
