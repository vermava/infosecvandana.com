Users always wants to make sure they have everything is working, they are able to use the website and at the same time their identities are secure. There is a huge shift in the traditional Identity and access management and now with the time, we have to modernize the Identities. We are talking about consumer IAM as well.

I had the opportunity to speak at #commercebytes platform with the e-commerce owners. With the talk, I shared what are the challenges e-commerce organisations face while managing the user identities and at the same time why users tend to leave the application. How balancing usability and security becomes important when talking care of the users.
