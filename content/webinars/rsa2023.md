**Proactive Defense: Advanced Threat Modeling for Robust Cybersecurity**

<br>
Aug. 1, 2023 | 01:00 PM ET | 10:00 AM PT

As cyberthreats become increasingly sophisticated and widespread, organizations must proactively safeguard their assets. This requires advanced threat modeling techniques beyond traditional approaches to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities. This webcast will outline a framework for proactive defense using advanced threat modeling, which involves identifying, analyzing, and prioritizing potential threats to an organization's systems and data. The framework leverages machine learning algorithms, threat intelligence feeds, and expert knowledge to anticipate and mitigate emerging threats before they can be exploited. Attendees will learn how this approach can be integrated into an organization's overall cybersecurity strategy to create a more robust and resilient defense posture. By adopting a proactive defense approach to advanced threat modeling, organizations can stay ahead of the ever-evolving threat landscape and protect their critical assets from compromise.
