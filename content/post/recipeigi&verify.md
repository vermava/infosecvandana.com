Recently I have been experimenting with various IBM product integrations and I posted a reciepe in IBM Community portal for integration of IBM IGI with IBM Security Verify. 

This recipe talks about the ideal set of steps that someone has to take to connect the two applications.

Here is a direct link to the article.
