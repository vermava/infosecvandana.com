Abstract: According to a 2019 survey, roughly 25% of the overall cybersecurity workforce consists of women. While this is considerably better than 2017, when only 11% of its survey participants were women, there is still a long way to go to address this large gender gap.

Considering the various ongoing industry challenges — dramatic gender imbalance and the rising talent gap — several golden opportunities for women to work their way up to significant leadership roles are opening up. Cybersecurity is a vast industry that needs professionals for different primary functions, such as security operations, compliance, incident handling, investigations, auditing, training, and several others. As a woman, you have the choice to choose from dozens of such positions.

This webinar will take you through the roles women have played in the past in the cybersecurity industry and how it has changed over the years, as well as the general misconceptions and myths about women leaders in the cybersecurity industry, straight from global women leaders thriving in the world of cybersecurity.
