**Impact of COVID-19 on Cloud Adoption & Security** at **CSA India Annual Summit**

The onset of the pandemic has thrown normalcy out of gear. There is talk of a “new normal”, which continues to be defined and remains as broad as ever. The synapse between the COVID-19 pandemic and cloud security imperatives can be addressed with a call to action that the new cyber & cloud security strategy on the anvil can address. There must be sync with these modern realities and adaptation along with the willingness to innovate for future disruptions which will in turn reinvigorate our trust and boost our digital immunity.
