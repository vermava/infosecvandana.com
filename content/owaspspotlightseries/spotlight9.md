About the Project:-
The Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) is an open framework to help organizations formulate and implement a strategy for software security that is tailored to the specific risks facing the organization. SAMM helps you:
* Evaluate an organization’s existing software security practices
* Build a balanced software security assurance program in well-defined iterations
* Demonstrate concrete improvements to a security assurance program
* Define and measure security-related activities throughout an organization
