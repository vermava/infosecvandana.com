There has been a lot of conversations around diversity and inclusion in the recent past.  This is a step in a positive direction. The benefits of diversity in cybersecurity are clear. As an industry, we can do better, we need to do better. We need not only to keep the conversation going but to really place some action behind it. While homogenous teams feel easier to operate in, it can lead to stagnation, or specialisations in some aspects at the expense of others.

In this talk, I will present some of my thoughts on the importance and benefits of diversity and inclusion in our industry. I will share some of my experiences working over the last few years towards diversity initiatives, some real change observed, challenges associated with it and small steps anyone can do to improve diversity.
