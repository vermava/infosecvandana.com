Session: Implementing Zero Trust in an organisation to be uncertainty Ready


The Current unprecedented situation has changed the IT World forever, no matter what the outcome is, the conceptual changes in the working styles of people are here to stay. The world will never get back to the plane jane everything works only on this building for most of the work environment.

Currently most of the firms have scrambled to enable the workforce to work from home with a certain level of security. This is a band aid fix at best in current time, However the concept of zero trust has been present for ages and is the right kind of solution we need for such situations.

The talk will focus on the concept and demystification of zero trust models at the time of uncertainty. We should focus on implementation and deployment scenarios of zero trust for organizations. How should the business prepare for the transition, what are the architectural requirements and what policies are required to be implemented. We will also accentuate the Security teamâ€™s responsibilities which will be substantiated by use cases with respect to the same.
