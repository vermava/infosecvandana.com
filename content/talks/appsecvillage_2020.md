Title: Running an appsec program with open source projects

We are all heading towards the modernization of applications. However, we still see the companies being impacted with the most common website vulnerabilities like SQL Injection, Sensitive data exposure, security misconfiguration, etc.
OWASP has many projects which can be tied seamlessly into the application development pipeline structure. However, firstly we donâ€™t know if the projects exist, second, if we know about the projects, we do not know the exact working of the projects. In the talk, I will be talking about how to run an AppSec program with open source projects (OWASP Projects)
