**"Atomic Talk Title: Defending the unknown using AI and cybersecurity"**

New and unknown threats emerge daily, making traditional cybersecurity methods insufficient. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming how we defend against these unknown threats by enabling predictive analysis, real-time monitoring, and automated responses.

AI can detect patterns, anomalies, and suspicious behaviors that humans may overlook, helping to safeguard systems before attacks occur. By combining AI with human expertise, organizations can create a more robust defense strategy, allowing them to identify and neutralize threats faster and more efficiently. This synergy between AI and cybersecurity is essential for staying ahead in the fight against evolving digital dangers.

Talk Takeaways
- AI enhances detection of unknown threats.
- Automation streamlines cybersecurity tasks.
- AI predicts future attacks, enabling proactive defense.
- Faster response times to emerging threats.
- Human-AI collaboration strengthens security.
