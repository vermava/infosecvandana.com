**Why a free workshop?**
The OWASP volunteer community and our Women in AppSec Committee (WIA) Committee commit to training the leaders behind securing the World Wide Web… That’s YOU! Your learning path starts (or continues) here. We’re excited to form mentorships at this year’s AppSec USA conference.

**Breakdown of Topics:**

*Scope a security review and prioritise the work

*Understand the manual and automated tools and techniques available and when to apply them

*Learn how to determine the real risk value.

*In order to achieve these goals assess the OWASP Top Ten security areas within a real world application.
