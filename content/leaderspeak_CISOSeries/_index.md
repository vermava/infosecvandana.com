title: A day in the life of a CISO
description: 'Leader Speak'
---

Every Leader has a journey. With the leaderspeak, I am trying to get to know their journy, what are the hurdles they have faced and how does their day looks like being a CISO. The things we can learn from them.

Some of the people I respect the most, have learned the most from, are those who have different opinions and perspectives than my own.
