The time is challenging. No one ever believed that a pandemic would leave us stranded. We will be home for such a long time even though some of us always wanted to work from home but never this way. Most of the organisations are trying to keep the spirits of the employees high and making sure they are safe from the critical situation outside. For many companies especially start ups who didn't have the infrastructure and facilities for the employees and were surviving just on the need base. 

 With work life and personal life so completely intertwined at home, both employees and organisations are concerned about security and privacy issues. Attackers are also using the situation to their advantage and cyber attacks are at their peak as well as the thresholds for web traffic are spiking high. For an organisation it's even a bigger challenge how to enable their teams to work securely keep their personal and organisation data safe.

 The companies who never worked in such an agile fashion from working anywhere, its a bigger challenge to cope up with, during these times. Lots of people are trying to figure out how to connect to clients' environments when VPN seems to be clogged because of the high traffic.

**There are certain security challenges which organisations are facing while trying to enable the remote workforce**

We will go back to normal but that will be ‘New Normal”. The situation is giving us a new way to look at things, how things can be planned and be uncertainty ready. This situation we are in will re-establish the importance of security which is sometimes ignored by many organisations.
