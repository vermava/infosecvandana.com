If you're in need to have you need to be able to know what your client is looking for you know, instead of painting him or her an elephant. They may want a goat I don't know.  You're telling the client hey why don't you buy this beautiful white elephant and they're saying, I want to go but you're not listening you're telling. My elephant is the best biggest fattest elephant.
