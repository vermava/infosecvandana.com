Learnings for the Mentees:
1. Never box yourself: Be open and flexible, all of us as human beings tend to sometimes box ourselves into have boundaries, we say Oh, this is my background, this is what I have studied. This is what I have you know worked in, and therefore this is what I should do, and this is where I should be in you know five years in two years, and so on. In the process, we often miss out on opportunities around us, which come at you from different angles, so I always tell people be open and be flexible, I wasn't the first few years of my life I was very boxed in you know, and I had, I was very lucky to have. Mentors who sort of broke those barriers, and also because I worked in a startup environment where you don't have the luxury of too much of structure. I think that combination, but I am richer as a person and as an individual thanks to that so that's one thing I definitely would say oh second is.

2. Persistence:  There isn't anything that comes overnight, there is this fallacy of overnight successes is is a fallacy or you have to stay at it, no matter what no matter there'll be times when you want to give up, but I feel, nothing is impossible for anybody. Just that you to stay the course remove all the distractions and you will get to where you want to go, maybe you will not get you may have planned a goal, but you may end up somewhere else, which is even.
 brighter and more lucrative but stay put work hard stay the course that's The second thing I would say.

3.Attention to detail, you just have to pay attention to detail, as they say, the devils in the detail, but the angel is also in the detail, you know so pay attention to detail at all times yeah I think these two things I would probably recommend.
